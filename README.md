# Replication of Benchmark Metrics on Graph Neural Networks

In fields like biology, social networks, and transportation systems, it's hard to represent all relevant data in a tabular format. To represent these, we need to use a Graph-based approach. However, early methods struggled to fully grasp the complicated structures of graph data. This project explores various Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on graph benchmark datasets and evaluates the performance of different approaches. Specifically, by assessing the capability of the transformer-based graph model, it aims to provide insights into its potential and possibility of exceeding traditional GNN architectures' effectiveness.
